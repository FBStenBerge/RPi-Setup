RPi-Setup
=========

This repository contains instructions for fast-forward Raspberry Pi setup with Raspbian without a monitor and keyboard - just a network cable.

I've installed and reinstalled my Pi's a lot of times and each time there is something new to it. I will try to update this as soon as I discover something new to it.
