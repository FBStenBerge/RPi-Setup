		<h1>Raspberry Pi ASAP Setup Guide</h1>

		<p class="lead">A fast way to setup Raspberry Pi with Raspbian. This guide is a combination of information found on the internet and experience. Feel free to contribute via <a href="https://github.com/kr15h/RPi-Setup">GitHub</a>.</p>



		<!-- SECTION -->
		<h2>1. Before starting get all the following</h2>


    <h3>Hardware</h3>
    <ul id="hardware-list">
      <li><b>Raspberry Pi model B.</b> <span class="lesser">We need an ethernet port, and the model A doesn't have one.</span></li>
      <li><b>A computer.</b> <span class="lesser">Linux, Mac and Windows are all fine.</span></li>
      <li><b>High speed SD card.</b> <span class="lesser">This is were we will install the Operating system for the Pi. Try to find a proper SD card for the job. It should be at least with 4 GB capacity. Class 4 to 10 have been working allright for me so far. It is better to choose one with a higher class number. There is a list of SD cards that have been tested with the Raspberry Pi <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards">here</a>. I usually go with SanDisk or Kingston.</span></li>
      <li><b>SD card port or external reader.</b> <span class="lesser">You need to be able to read / write on the SD card with your laptop.</span></li>
      <li><b>Power adapter for Raspberry Pi.</b> <span class="lesser">5V, 1–1.5A, most phone chargers with a <i>micro USB type B</i> plug are fine.</span></li>
      <li><b>Network cable.</b> <span class="lesser">Cat 6 ethernet cable, basically cables you have at home should be fine.</span></li>
      <li><b>Ethernet port or USB adapter.</b> <span class="lesser">You need to be able to connect your laptop to the raspberry Pi via ethernet.</span></li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Software</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <h4>SSH client</h4>
  		<p>We will be using SSH a lot to communicate with the Pi form our laptop. SSH (Secure SHell) is a secure network protocol that allows to control other computers over network. <span class="mac linux">There is no problem with a SSH client on Mac or Linux - Terminal can handle SSH without any issues.</span><span class="win">If you are using Windows, download <a href="http://www.putty.org">Putty</a> for using it as your SSH client.</span></p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4>SCP client</h4>
      <p>We will need to upload and download files to and from the Raspberry Pi. For this, we will use SCP (Secure CoPy or Secure Copy Protocol) which is built on top of the SSH protocol and allows secure transfer of files. Download <a href="https://filezilla-project.org">FileZilla</a>. It works on Mac, Linux and Windows. <span class="win">You might consider <a href="http://winscp.net">WinSCP</a> as your weapon of choice if you are using Windows.</span></p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4>Program to format SD card</h4>
      <p><span class="mac win">Download <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/">SDFormatter</a>. </span><span class="mac">You can use Mac Disk Utility, but SDFormatter is the recomended way.</span></p>
      <span class="linux">Use <a href="http://gparted.org">GParted</a> to format your SD card to FAT32 file system.</span></p>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Know-how</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <h4>Shell / command-line interpreter</h4>
		  <p>Basic knowledge of shell and <a href="http://www.johnstowers.co.nz/blog/pages/bash-cheat-sheet.html">shell scripting</a> will be useful as we will be using the shell more than once.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <h4>Nano</h4>
      <p>In a shell, to edit a file you need to use command line text-editing tools like <a href="http://www.tuxradar.com/content/text-editing-nano-made-easy">nano</a>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>A wireless Internet connection.</h3>
    Yep ... you will need it for setting-up everything, and installing software on your Pi once it is ready.



		<h2>2. Installing Raspbian</h2>

		<p>Raspbian is the operating system that we are going to install on the Raspberry Pi. You can download the most recent version <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">here</a> and unarchive it. The archive contains only one file : a full image of the Raspbian system.</p>


		<h3>Formatting the SD card</h3>

		<p>Before installing Raspbian, you must prepare your SD card by formatting it to FAT32 file system. Some may say that it is useless as we will rewrite the whole file system in the next steps, but it is recomended to do it if your SD card will be used for the first time.</p>

		<p class="mac win">Format the SD card to FAT32 file system using SDFormatter (which you should have installed if you followed from the beginning), <span class="mac">or Mac Disk Utility.</span></p>

		<p class="linux">Use GParted to format your SD card to FAT32 file system.</p>

		
		<h3>Finding out the device ID of the SD card.</h3>

		<div class="mac">

    <p>First, you must insert the SD card, and eject it by clicking on the "eject" icon in the finder.</p>
		<p>Then, open your Terminal, type <code>diskutil list</code> and press <kbd>enter ↵</kbd> to see what devices are connected to your computer. The output in the Terminal window will look similar to the following:</p>

		<pre>/dev/disk0
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *256.1 GB   disk0
   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1
   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            255.2 GB   disk0s2
   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3</pre>

   		<p>Next - insert your SD card and issue the <code>diskutil list</code> command again. Press <kbd>enter ↵</kbd> and this time you should get output similar to this:</p>

   		<pre>/dev/disk0
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *256.1 GB   disk0
   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1
   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            255.2 GB   disk0s2
   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3
/dev/disk1
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *3.9 GB     disk1
   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 EMPTY                   3.9 GB     disk1s1
</pre>
		
		<p>As you see, there is a new device - <code>/dev/disk1</code>. On your computer, the device ID might be different (e.g. if you have more devices connected). Try to find the ID that was not there before you inserted the SD card.</p>


    <h3>Burning Raspbian on the SD card</h3>

		<p>In you terminal, navigate to the directory where your Raspbian image was extracted. Mine was extracted in my home directory <code>/Users/me/</code>, so I need to type <code>cd /Users/me/</code> and press <kbd>enter ↵</kbd>.

    <p>Let's check that the image is there by typing <code>ls</code> and pressing <kbd>enter ↵</kbd>. A list of all files and sub-folders in the current directory should be printed, and you should see the extracted Raspbian image in the list. For example, mine is called <code>2014-01-07-wheezy-raspbian.img</code>.</p>

		<p>Now let's burn this. Unmount the SD card by running the <code>diskutil unmount /dev/&lt;ID&gt;</code> command. Of course, replace <code>&lt;ID&gt;</code> with the device ID you found in the previous step.</p>

		<p>Wait till the disk is unmounted and then continue with the most important part - overwritting the contents of the SD card with the image.</p>

		<blockquote class="alert-danger"><p><b>WARNING:</b> be very careful with this as you can accidentaly damage your computer's system drive if you enter the wrong device ID.</p></blockquote>

		<pre>sudo dd if=&lt;image&gt; of=/dev/&lt;ID&gt; bs=1m</pre>

		<p><code>if</code> is the input, <code>of</code> is the output and <code>bs</code> is the size of chunk of data that is being written to the output. Replace <code>&lt;image&gt;</code> by the name of your image file, and <code>&lt;ID&gt;</code> by the device ID of your SD card. For example, with the ID I found in previous step and the image file I have dowloaded, the command looks like the following :
    <code>sudo dd if=2014-01-07-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/disk1 bs=1m</code>.
    But be careful, as - once again - your device ID and image file might be different as mine.</p>

		<p>Once you have double checked the ID, and image file name, execute the command. This process will take some time. So go make a coffee. And a sandwich. Don't worry if it seems to be idle. It isn't.</p>

		<p>Once your Terminal has returned to it's normal state (you can tell that by being able to issue simple commands like <code>ls</code> and <code>cd</code>), eject the SD card by using <code>diskutil eject /dev/disk1</code>. When the terminal has returned to it's normal state, you can remove your SD card.</p>

    <h2>3. Launching the Pi</h2>
    
    <h3>Assigning IP addresses</h3>

    <p>In order to access the Raspberry Pi via ethernet, we will need to give it an IP address.</p>
    <p>To do that, insert the SD card in the reader, and show the its contents. There should be a file named <code>cmdline.txt</code>. This file contains options that are passed to the Linux kernel as it boots up. Open the file in your favorite text editor. We need to add the following at the end of the existing content:</p>

    <pre>ip=192.168.1.200::192.168.1.1:255.255.255.0:rpi:eth0:off</pre>
    
    <p>For example, after doing this, my <code>cmdline.txt</code> file looks like :</p>

    <pre>dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait ip=192.168.1.200::192.168.1.1:255.255.255.0:rpi:eth0:off</pre>

    <p>We will be able to access the Pi through network with the IP address <code>192.168.1.200</code> after we set our ethernet connections TCP/IP settings correctly.</p>
    <p>Adjust your computer's network settings. Set the IP address to <code>192.168.1.200</code>, netmask to <code>255.255.255.0</code> and the gateway (router) address to <code>192.168.1.1</code>. You may need to disconnect from any wireless networks to make this work.</p>

    <h3>Booting up - the first time</h3>
    <p>Connect your Raspberry Pi to the computer with an ethernet cable, eject the SD card from your computer, and put it in the Pi before powering-it up. Plug-in the power adapter.</p>

    <p>First try to ping the Pi by typing the following command in the Terminal: <code>ping 192.168.1.200</code>. Press <kbd>enter ↵</kbd>. There should be response:</p>
    <pre>64 bytes from 192.168.1.200: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=52.941 ms</pre>

    <p>If that is true, let's try to connect to the Pi via SSH.</p>

    <div class="mac linux">
      <p>Type <code>ssh pi@192.168.1.200</code> in the Terminal. Enter <code>raspberry</code> once promted for a password and press <kbd>enter ↵</kbd>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="win">
      <p>Use Putty to connect to the Raspberry Pi by using IP address <code>192.168.1.200</code>, username <code>pi</code> and password <code>raspberry</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Now we're in. Let's change the real network settings.</p>

    <p>To do that open the <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> file in an text editor like the commandline nano. Type <code>sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces</code> in to the <span class="mac linux">Terminal</span><span class="win">Putty</span> window.</p>

    <p>Add the following content there:</p>

    <pre>auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet static

address 192.168.1.200
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1</pre>

    <p>Press <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd> to exit and then <kbd>Y+enter ↵</kbd> to save.</p>

    <p>Now we have to remove the extra line from <code>cmdline.txt</code> that we added earlier. To do that, open the file in nano by typing <code>sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt</code> in <span class="mac linux">Terminal</span><span class="win">Putty</span> and pressing <kbd>enter ↵</kbd>.</p>

    <p>Delete the <code>ip=192.168.1.200::192.168.1.1:255.255.255.0:rpi:eth0:off</code> part and press <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd> to exit and then <kbd>Y+enter ↵</kbd> to save the file.</p>

    <p>Now, let's reboot our Pi by using the <code>sudo reboot</code> command.</p>

    <p>If all is well, in approximately 15 to 30 seconds you will be able to connect to the Pi via SSH by using IP address <code>192.168.1.200</code> (if you have not changed it for something else), username <code>pi</code> and password <code>raspberry</code>.</p>



		<h2>4. Sharing your computer's internet connection with the Raspberry Pi</h2>

		<p>In order to install new software on your freshly installed Raspbian, you will need to give your Pi Internet access. In this step we will configure our computer to share it's internet connection with our the Pi via an ethernet cable.</p>

	<section>
		<h2>Expanding partition</h2>
		<p>In this step we are going to make use of the whole free space on our SD card.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Auto Login</h2>
		
		<p>To make your pi log in automatically, run the following line in the shell:</p>

		<pre>sudo nano /etc/inittab</pre>
		
		<p>Comment (by using #) the line starting the terminal tty1 ("<code>1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1</code>"), and just bellow it add:</p>

		<pre>1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f pi tty1 /dev/tty1 2>&1</pre>

		<p>Close file and save by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd> and <kbd>Y</kbd> and then <kbd>enter ↵</kbd>.</p>
	</section>

	<h2>Preventing the screen from going blank</h2>

	<p>If you are using your Pi through SSH without an actual keyboard connected, the screen might go to sleep after some time as your Pi does not detect any activity. To prevent that, edit the <code>rc.local</code> file by opening it in the nano editor: <code>sudo nano /etc/rc.local</code></p>

	<p>Add the following line just before the <code>exit 0</code> line:</p>

	<pre>sh -c 'setterm -blank 0 -powersave off -powerdown 0 < /dev/console > /dev/console 2>&1'</pre>

	<p>Hit <kbd>Ctrl+x</kbd> and <kbd>y</kbd> and <kbd>Retunr</kbd> to quit and save. Reboot your Pi: <code>sudo reboot</code>. Now the screen will stay awake.</p>

	<section>
		<h2>Startup scripts</h2>

		Starting a program on boot
		<p>In <code>/home/pi</code> create an executable shell script called <code>startup.sh</code>:</p>

	<pre>touch startup.sh
chmod a+x startup.sh</pre>
		
		<p>Then open <code>.bashrc</code></p> 

		<pre>sudo nano ~/.bashrc</pre>

		<p>and add the following line at the end of the file:</p>

		<pre>~/startup.sh</pre>

		<p>I think it is a good idea not to run everythin when you log in via SSH next time. Edit the <code>startup.sh</code> file to distinguish between direct login and SSH access. Open the file in text editor:</p>

		<pre>sudo nano ~/startup.sh</pre>

		<p>Replace the contents of the file with the following:</p>

		<pre>#!/bin/bash

echo "Checking SSH connection...";
if [ -z "$SSH_CONNECTION" ]; then
	echo "No SSH connection, launching scripts.";
	# Your scripts here
else
	echo "SSH connection, nothing to be launched.";
fi</pre>

		<p>You can add your own scripts just after the <code># Your scripts here</code> line.</p>

		<p>Close and save the file by using <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd>, <kbd>y</kbd> and <kbd>enter ↵</kbd>.</p>
